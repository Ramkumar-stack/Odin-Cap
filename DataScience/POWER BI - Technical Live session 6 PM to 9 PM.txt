POWER BI -

Business  - Work, Profit, Loss, Occupation 
Intelligence - 

Power BI - It is a leading in the market. 

Componets of Power BI: 

5 Components 

1. Power BI Desktop  - It's a free Tool - You can install it in your local machine 

This application is available only for Windows OS

There is no app for MAC OS 

You will be manipulating ( Data Preprocessing / Data Transformation) the data and creating the Visuals 

We will be working on the Power BI Desktop

Once you create reports - you need to share them to your client 

2. Power BI Service - Where you will be sharing and collbarting the reports to the end user 

3. Power BI Mobile - In Android and IOS devices - Only view the reports 

4. Power BI embedded - Pro and Premium versions - by the large organizations

5. Power BI Report Server - Pro versions

Power BI uses M Language 

Architecture of Power BI

Think that you are Data Analyst 
Your Mother - Client 


Your Mother asked you to go to the Super Store and buy Grocery!!!!

Step1 : List of Items 
Step 2: Money
Step 3: Crosscheck the items with your mother
Step 4: In your English conversion 

You will be getting the data from Different Sources 


Step 5: Store

Power BI Desktop 

Step 6: Explore and search your items and place them in a basket 
Step 7: Dhamaka Offer - 5 kg Atta with 2kg Sugar Free 
Step 8 : Cross-checking - Additional Items - Mother 

Data Transformation - Power Query Editor

Power 
Query - Tables in Power BI 
Editor - Where you will be performing Data preprocessing steps 


Step 9: Payment or Billing 
Step 10 : Cross-check the Payment and products 
Step 11: Back to home with Grocery

Power BI Service 


Step 12: Crosscheck the items with your mother and she arrange them in a appropriate location 
Step 13: She will be comparing the bill with the previous months
Step 14: If you give a suggestion will your Mother use 100%


We have seen "How to download the Power BI Desktop" ?


Power BI Desktop is the Advanced version of Excel 


If you are using Android phone for 5 years - If I ask you change the ringtone settings?

All of sudden I gifted Iphone 15 Pro - If I ask you change the ringtone settings?

You seek help from your friends/ YouTube Videos, Surfing

Table View - Seeing the structure of the Table 

Model View - Seeing the Relation between the tables. 

Panes 

1. Filter Pane

2. Visualization Pane - 40 + visuals 

3. Data Pane 


Canvas - where you will be adding the visuals 

1. CSV
2. Excel 
3. PDF
4. HTML
5. TXT
6. Json 
7. Folder 
8. Database
9. Server 


Mahesh Database - It is an Authorised one - 

Yes 

Navigator - Shows the direction or Path or Indicator 

Load - When No Transformation required 

Tranform Data - When Transformation required 

Cancel - I don't want to any operation 

In Excel or Word - CTRL + Z - UNDO 


Decimal - 876.3245346457567356

When you apply transformation on One Column is it going to apply only on that column or entire dataset in row data? 


entire dataset in row-wise data

O - Observed 
F - Forecast 

Transform - Within the existing column it is going apply the Transformation Technique 

Add Column - It will create a new column with the Transformation Technique

Pivot and Un-pivot 

For Data Analysis 

Pivot - it will convert - Rows into Columns 
Unpivot - it will convert - Columns into Rows 

Merge Queries 

Join or Combine 

Mutiple Sheets - I want them in a single Table 

Table 1 + Table 2 with Common Column 


Columns are Increasing or Rows are Increasing?

Merge Queries = Columns are Increasing


Table 1 - 10 Col, 100 Rows
Table 2 - 100 Col, 12 Rows 

Matching Column


Append And Visualizations 


Merge - Table 1 with 10R X 15C
Table 2: 15 R X 9 C
Table 3 45R X 46C

I have common Column from all the 3 tables

Power BI Key Points:
-------------------------
1. Understand the Requirement
2. Understand the Data
3. Understand your Audience ( End-Users - who interactive with your reports)
4. Understand which chart to create / use and when?



Power BI Charts Details:
------------------------------
Text Tables, Hightlight Tables - Eye for detail

Comparitive Analysis - Bar Charts, Side by Side Bars and Column Charts 

Composition Analysis - Stacked Bars, Pie Charts, Donut Chart, Tree Map (Proportion to whole)

Trend Analysis - Time Series Data - Line Charts and Area Charts

Correlation Analysis - Scatter Plots and Heat maps

Values and Value 

Is a Card View 


IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT 


EXPLICIT - Manually 
Implicit - Default - SUM 


Manger to show all the Aggreation functions in a report

SUM
AVG
MIN
MAX 


for Implicit  Measure - SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT,

FOR EXPLICT MEASURE - MIN or MAX or AVG 

Calculated Measure can be viewed in REPORT VIEW using a CARD VISUAL 

explicit is STatic  and implicit is Dynamic 


CCls - Can be created in Table View 

inorder to extract YEAR 

A = YEAR(Table_Name(Column_Name))

OrdersYear = Year(Orders[Ship Date]))

Format 


Orders_MonthName = FORMAT(Orders[Order Date], "mmmm")

MMMM - give me complete MONTH Name 

Quater - Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 

Calendar and AutoCalendar 

Dates

Calendar - Start Date and End Date 


In my dataset there is no Date Column i have only Index column
Create a line chart on the data? 

Start date is 1st  of Jan 2022 
End date is 31st March 2023 

Calendar(STart_Date , ENd_Date)

new table
new column 
establish a relationship between date table and orders tables with a macthing column 
create a line chart 


x = Huge Amount of data - 1945 to till date 2024 - Big data 

data from 2023 to till date (Current Date) 

y = New table 

calendar = start and end date 
Jan 1st of 2023  - Start date
July 27th of 2024 - End date

relationship between x & y 

Autocalendar 

It will fetch, is there any data in your datamodel 

It will consider it as a start date and end date will be your current end of the year


for ex: date is having a column called as Ship date = Feb 14th 2022

STart date as Feb 14th 2022 - 31st dec 2024 

15th of Dec 2024 


current running business - 1st of Jan 2023 to 27th of July 2024 

Autocalendar 

1st of Jan 2023 to 31st of Dec 2024 


28th of July 2024 to 31st of Dec 2024


100 Columns - 
Feature engineering - 15 columns

If there is one condition to check Yes or NO 

if (sales > 2000, "High", "low")

sales = 900 = low 

sales = 2500 = high

sales = 2000 = low


one quick question
in  OR / AND multiple conditions  , what sequence the execution will be ?
do we need to put brackets to differ the sequence ?


If you are having Multiple conditions with only 2 results either True or False = Logical functions

If you are having Only 1 condition with 1 output wither true or false = IF Condition

If you are having Multiple Conditions with Multiple outputs = Switch

SWITCH( True(),
